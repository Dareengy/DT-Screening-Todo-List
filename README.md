# 📌 DT Screening - Todo List

## Overview
This is a simple To-Do List web application built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The app allows users to add, complete, and delete tasks. It is responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Add a task by typing and clicking the "Add" button or pressing "Enter"
- ✅ Mark a task as completed by clicking on it (adds a strike-through)
- ✅ Delete a task using the ❌ button
- ✅ Fully responsive layout with clean UI

## How I Tackled the Task
I started by setting up the basic HTML structure, followed by styling it using external CSS for a clean and responsive design. Then I wrote JavaScript to handle task interactions like adding, completing, and deleting tasks. I ensured that pressing the Enter key also adds a task for better usability.

## Time Management
I completed the entire project within the 2-hour time frame. I focused first on functionality, then on styling and responsiveness.

## Challenges
The main challenge was making sure the design remained clean and mobile-friendly without using any frameworks. I also paid attention to ensuring the code remained organized and readable, with no use of inline styles or unnecessary logic.
